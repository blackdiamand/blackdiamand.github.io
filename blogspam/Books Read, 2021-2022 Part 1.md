# Books Read, 2021-2022 Part 1
This first digital garden series will hopefully replace my long spreadsheet of books read. I have read around 20 million words in books alone, and that's not counting newspapers, articles, HN comments, class assignments, and all sorts of other random things. But without further ado, let's get started!
####  The Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the Human Race
It's by Walter Isaacson of _Steve Jobs_ biography fame, so knew it would be good. His timing on the publication is a testament to great skill. The Steve Jobs biography was timed near his death, and now this book when the groundbreaking CRISPR research is widely used in many discoveries today. 
#### The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives
Wow, such an enlightening and inspirational book. I'm relatively new to social science topics and this is such a fascinating read. Everything is especially relevant in the digital age.
#### The World: A Brief Introduction
It's pretty average, I knew most things, and is intended to cover many topics quickly for people new to international relations and foreign policy. Despite what many think, the President of the United States has quite limited powers, and foreign policy is the singular issue that the President is largely responsible to. Hope to pick up some further books.
