Due to many requests on the Manifold Discord, currently I am writing a trading bot guide for Manifold Markets, provisionally available [here.](https://github.com/blackdiamand/manifold/blob/main/docs/docs/bot_guide.md) I hope to have a minimal working guide finished in a month or so, hosted on the Manifold website.

Why am I writing this, you may ask? You should [support the project on Manifund](https://manifund.org/projects/improving-the-api-experience-1gvwtzspgw3j) by buying impact certificate shares, if you think this is a worthwile project! If you are new to impact certificates, it is similar to buying shares on how much value the project will bring to the community. I strongly believe that innovative funding mechanisms that give an incentive for project creators to succeed and investors to find worthwile projects are a more effective idea, than the current system of grantwriting. Give it a try!
