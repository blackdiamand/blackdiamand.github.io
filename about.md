Welcome to my site! Here I post my maps of whatever I find interesting. 

In addition, I may post election mapping guides if enough people are interested. 

##### Unsolicited yet great tips for PredictIt and other prediction markets

First, make sure that you do not live in [the 21 states that prohibit elections gambling.](https://web.archive.org/web/20180406192459/https://www.ncsl.org/blog/2014/09/17/wagering-on-elections-not-a-smart-bet.aspx) Secondly, if betting on election day, make all your bets assuming the site will go down. The best times to bet are after events in the news cycle. Always take the under if bettors are overreacting, which is usually the case. 

Follow the "sell at 90 cents" rule, it will not get you burned by rules cucks and random events. Hedging is always good! 

Don't buy at over 50 cents. You have far more to lose and will lose if you panic sell.

Conventional/Pundit wisdom: don't follow it. You can make a ton of money betting against Cook et al. They have an incentive to "be mainstream".

Thanks!
