Welcome to my site! Here I post my maps of whatever I find interesting. 

In addition, I may post election mapping guides if enough people are interested. 

##### Unsolicited yet great tips for PredictIt and other prediction markets

I will not leak any of my edge/alpha before the resolution of a market. In fact, I actively withhold strategic information from others in comments and discussions, but do not actively mislead others (man, that has never happened before in that Rita Hart market).

First, make sure that you do not live in [the 21 states that prohibit elections gambling.](https://web.archive.org/web/20180406192459/https://www.ncsl.org/blog/2014/09/17/wagering-on-elections-not-a-smart-bet.aspx) (what's a vast beverage nit?) Secondly, if betting on election day, make all your bets assuming the site will go down. This has occurred especially on this NZ based academic prediction market. The best times to bet are after events in the news cycle. Always take the under if bettors are overreacting, which is usually the case. 

Follow the "sell at 90+ cents" rule, it will not get you burned by rules cucks and random events. Hedging is always good! 

Don't buy at over 50 cents. You have far more to lose and will lose if you panic sell.

Conventional/Pundit wisdom: don't follow it. You can make a ton of money betting against Cook et al. Cannot believe people pay $35 a month for their lackluster analysis. They have an incentive to "be mainstream".

This is not financial advice.
